## Imgur Voice

We're making a voice search for imgur.com. It will take use of the Web Speech API available in Chrome.

- [Workshop's finished project](https://carpetfizz.github.io/imgur-voice/)
- [Google's example for the web speech API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API?hl=en)
- [Web Speech API Documentation (dense)](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html)


### Prerequisites

- Have git working -- ask for help if you are having trouble with git

- Have a text editor

- Know how to user the developer tools in Chrome [refresher](https://github.com/dvcoders/intro-html-css/blob/master/reference/README.md#what-are-your-browsers-developer-tools-and-how-can-they-be-used)

- [Register your app with imgur to use their API](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient)
	- Create an imgur account if you don't have one
	- Name your app what you want
	- Authorization Type: `Anonymous usage without user authorization`
	- Callback URL: `https://localhost:8000`
